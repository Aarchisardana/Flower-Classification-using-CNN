# Flower-Classification-using-CNN
   In this machine learning project  i had  used the cnn  and  it will identify the the  images of  flowers  which is  in dataset   i had taken the 5 samples  which are 
    rose , daisy , dandelion ,  sunlfower , daisy 
  so if u downlaod  any image even  from the  googel  which should one of the flower from which is in the sample  then   it  will predict  the name of flower
   Streamlit is used to show the ui  part 




      when  u wil run the app.py file   in  vs code  u have to use the coammand  of Steeamlit run app.py  where   app is the  file name
